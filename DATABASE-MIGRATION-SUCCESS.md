## üîß Migration Process

The migration was performed directly via **Supabase SQL Editor** due to network/firewall issues preventing local Prisma connection.

### Scripts Used (in order):

1. **`FIX_EXISTING_TABLES.sql`** - Added missing columns to existing tables
2. **`FIX_CASE_STUDIES.sql`** - Fixed case_studies table structure
3. **`CREATE_MISSING_TABLES_SAFE.sql`** - Created all new tables with proper error handling

### Issues Resolved:

- ‚ùå **Local connection blocked** - Solved by using Supabase SQL Editor
- ‚ùå **ENUM syntax errors** - Fixed with `DO $$ BEGIN ... EXCEPTION ... END $$` blocks
- ‚ùå **Missing columns in existing tables** - Added via ALTER TABLE statements
- ‚ùå **Multiple .env files interfering** - Temporarily renamed during migration
