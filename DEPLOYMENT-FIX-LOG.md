# Deployment Fix Log
**Date**: October 19, 2024  
**Issue**: Admin app deployment failing

---

## Timeline of Fixes

### Issue #1: Workspace Package Dependencies
**Time**: 17:00 UTC  
**Problem**: Module resolution errors
- `@supabase/supabase-js` not found
- `@khaledaun/db` not found
- `zod` not found
- `sanitize-html` not found

**Solution**: Added direct dependencies to workspace packages  
**Commit**: `3596fe7`  
**Result**: ‚ùå Still failing (pnpm registry issues)

---

### Issue #2: PNPM Registry Errors
**Time**: 17:38 UTC  
**Problem**: `ERR_INVALID_THIS` errors when pnpm tries to fetch from npm registry
```
ERR_PNPM_META_FETCH_FAIL GET https://registry.npmjs.org/prisma: 
Value of "this" must be of type URLSearchParams
```

**Root Cause**: Vercel admin project configured to use pnpm, but pnpm has compatibility issues with Vercel's build environment

**Solution**: Created `apps/admin/vercel.json` to force npm usage
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build"
}
```

**Commit**: `2f90f69`  
**Status**: üîÑ Deploying now

## Expected Result

With both fixes applied:
1. ‚úÖ Workspace packages have direct dependencies
2. ‚úÖ Admin app uses npm instead of pnpm
3. ‚úÖ npm will use existing `package-lock.json`
4. ‚úÖ All dependencies should install correctly
5. ‚úÖ Build should succeed

---

## Verification Steps (After Deployment)

### 1. Check Build Logs
Look for:
```
‚úì npm install completed
‚úì Prisma Client generated
‚úì Next.js build succeeded
‚úì Deployment Ready
```

### 2. Test Health Endpoint
```bash
curl https://admin.khaledaun.com/api/health
# Expected: {"ok":true,"commit":"2f90f69"}
```

### 3. Test Admin Access
- Visit https://admin.khaledaun.com
- Verify login page loads
- Check dashboard accessible
- Test posts list (/posts)
- Test social embeds (/social)

## Configuration Files

### Root vercel.json (For Site App)
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "installCommand": "pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile",
  "buildCommand": "pnpm --filter @khaledaun/site build",
  "outputDirectory": "apps/site/.next"
}
```

### apps/admin/vercel.json (For Admin App)
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build"
}
```

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Workspace packages need explicit dependencies** in monorepo with npm
2. **pnpm has issues with Vercel** - use npm for more stable builds
3. **Each Vercel project needs its own config** if using different build tools
4. **package-lock.json is crucial** for npm deployments

---

## Next Deployment

**Triggered by**: Commit `2f90f69`  
**Expected Duration**: 3-5 minutes  
**Monitor at**: https://vercel.com/dashboard

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] npm install succeeds
- [ ] Prisma generate succeeds
- [ ] Next.js build succeeds
- [ ] Deployment goes live
- [ ] Health check returns 200
