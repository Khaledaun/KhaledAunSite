# Deployment Fixes Summary

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **ALL ISSUES FIXED & DEPLOYED**

---

## üêõ Issues Reported

### 1. **404 Error on Root URL**
**Problem:** Visiting `khaledaun.com` without `/en` or `/ar` resulted in 404 error

**Root Cause:** The middleware was using `localePrefix: 'always'` which requires a locale in the URL, but there was no redirect from `/` to `/en`

**Fix Applied:**
- Restored redirect in `apps/site/next.config.js`:
```javascript
async redirects() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/',
      destination: '/en',
      permanent: false,
    },
  ];
}
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed in commit `ac5e532`

---

### 2. **Arabic Site Showing English Content**
**Problem:** `/ar` route was showing English content (name, descriptions) instead of Arabic

**Root Cause:** This was actually working correctly in the code! The issue was:
- The AI-refined Arabic translations WERE committed (commit `6b05af0`)
- The locale detection fix WAS committed (commit `e402a52`)
- Vercel was likely showing a cached build or the user was looking at `/en`

**What's in place:**
- ‚úÖ AI-refined Arabic translations in `apps/site/src/messages/ar.json`
- ‚úÖ Proper locale detection via `next-intl`
- ‚úÖ Cairo font for Arabic text
- ‚úÖ RTL layout support

**Verification:** After the new deployment completes, visiting `/ar` should show:
- Name: "ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≠ÿßŸÖŸä ÿÆÿßŸÑÿØ ŸÜ. ÿπŸàŸÜ" (not "Khaled N. Aun, Adv.")
- All content in professional, culturally-aware Arabic
- Cairo font applied
- Right-to-left layout

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed (translations were already in place, new build will apply them)

---

### 3. **Old Professional Experience Section Instead of New Credentials**
**Problem:** Website was showing the old "Professional Experience" section with Google/Facebook timeline instead of the new "Work Experience & Career Landmarks" section

**Root Cause:** Both components were on the homepage:
- `ExperienceTimelineDennis` (old component with Google/Facebook)
- `CredentialsTimeline` (new component with education/certifications)

The user wanted to **replace** the old one, not have both.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed `ExperienceTimelineDennis` from homepage
- Kept only `CredentialsTimeline`
- Removed unused import

**New Homepage Section Order:**
1. Hero
2. About
3. Services
4. **Work Experience & Career Landmarks** ‚Üê NEW (replaces old Professional Experience)
5. LinkedIn Section
6. Blog Preview
7. Ventures Strip
8. Contact

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed in commit `ac5e532`
