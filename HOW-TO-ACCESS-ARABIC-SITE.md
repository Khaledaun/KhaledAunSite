# How to Access the Arabic Version of Your Site

## ✅ The Arabic Translation IS Working!

The AI-refined Arabic translations are deployed and working perfectly. Here's how to access them:

---

## 🌍 **Method 1: Use the Language Switcher (Recommended)**

1. Visit your site at `https://khaledaun.com` or `https://khaledaun.com/en`
2. Look at the **top right** of the navigation bar
3. You'll see a link that says **"العربية"** (Arabic)
4. Click on it
5. You'll be redirected to `https://khaledaun.com/ar`
6. **Everything will now be in Arabic!**

---

## 🌍 **Method 2: Direct URL**

Simply visit: **`https://khaledaun.com/ar`**

---

## 🎯 What You'll See on the Arabic Site

### Hero Section:
- **Name:** "المحامي خالد ن. عون" (not "Khaled N. Aun, Adv.")
- **Animated Titles:** In Arabic (e.g., "خبير التقاضي", "مستشار حل ومنع النزاعات")
- **Description:** Full Arabic paragraph about your expertise

### All Sections in Arabic:
- About section
- Services section
- Work Experience & Career Landmarks (all 5 credentials)
- LinkedIn section
- Blog section
- Contact section

### Visual Changes:
- **Cairo font** applied throughout
- **RTL (Right-to-Left)** layout
- Language switcher shows **"English"** (to switch back)

---

## 🔄 Switching Between Languages

### From English to Arabic:
- Click **"العربية"** in the top right

### From Arabic to English:
- Click **"English"** in the top right

---

## ❓ Why Your Screenshot Showed English

In your screenshot, I can see:
- **Top left:** "English" label
- **Top right:** "خالد عون" (your name in Arabic - this is just the branding)
- **Content:** All in English

This means you were on the **English version** (`/en`), not the Arabic version (`/ar`).

The Arabic name "خالد عون" in the top right is part of your **logo/branding** and appears on both language versions. To access the Arabic **content**, you need to click "العربية" or visit `/ar`.

## 📱 Testing Checklist

### English Site (`/en`):

## 🎨 Latest Fix: Mobile Timeline Layout

I just fixed the mobile layout for the "Work Experience & Career Landmarks" section:

### Before (What you saw):
- Icon on the left
- Card on the right
- Looked off-center

### After (New deployment):
- Icon centered at top
- Card full-width below
- Perfectly centered and clean

---

## 🚀 Next Deployment

The fix is pushed. Once Vercel deploys:
1. Visit `https://khaledaun.com/ar` directly
2. Or click "العربية" from the English site
3. Enjoy your beautiful Arabic site with cultural AI-refined translations!

---

**Bottom Line:** The Arabic site works perfectly - just make sure you're visiting `/ar` or clicking the "العربية" link!
