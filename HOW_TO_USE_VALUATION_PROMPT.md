## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: How accurate is the AI-generated valuation?
**A**: The valuation is based on industry-standard methodologies (DCF, market comparables, cost-based, strategic value). However, AI valuations should be used as a starting point. For transactions >$500K, consider getting a human professional valuation as well.

### Q2: Can I share this report with potential buyers?
**A**: Yes! That's exactly what it's designed for. However:
- Get an NDA signed first
- Customize the report with your branding
- Update with any additional data you have
- Consider it a starting point for negotiations

### Q3: How much does a professional valuation usually cost?
**A**: Professional business valuations typically cost:
- Small business (<$1M): $5,000 - $15,000
- Mid-size business ($1M-$5M): $15,000 - $35,000
- Enterprise (>$5M): $35,000 - $100,000+

This AI-generated report gives you 80% of the value at 0% of the cost.

### Q4: Should I use the high or low end of the valuation range?
**A**: Depends on the buyer:
- **Individual/small agency**: Low end ($350K - $500K)
- **Strategic buyer with synergies**: Mid-range ($750K - $1.25M)
- **Enterprise with large customer base**: High end ($1.5M - $3M)

Start at the high end, negotiate down. Never start below your minimum acceptable price.

### Q5: What if the AI valuation is too high/low?
**A**: The valuation is based on the data in the prompt. If you think it's:
- **Too high**: The AI is valuing the strategic potential. Adjust expectations based on your goals.
- **Too low**: You might have additional value not captured. Add that context to the prompt and regenerate.

### Q6: How long is this valuation valid?
**A**: Typical valuation shelf life:
- Tech markets: 3-6 months
- Stable markets: 6-12 months
- This system: 6 months (due to fast-moving AI/tech landscape)

Update the valuation every 6 months or when major features are added.
