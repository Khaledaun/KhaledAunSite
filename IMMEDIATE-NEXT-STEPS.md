## 📋 What You Need to Do Now (In Order)

### 1. **Verify Sites Are Accessible** (2 minutes)

Open these URLs in your browser:

- **Site**: https://khaledaun.site
  - Expected: Homepage loads, hero section visible, can navigate
  
- **Admin**: https://admin.khaledaun.site
  - Expected: Login page loads, can authenticate with Supabase

**Status**: ⏳ Waiting for your confirmation

---

### 2. **Run Database Migration** (5 minutes)

The production database is missing Phase 6.5 & 7 schema changes.

**Quick Command**:
```powershell
# Set your production DATABASE_URL
$env:DATABASE_URL="your-supabase-database-url-here"

# Run migration
cd packages/db
npx prisma db push
```

**What it does**: Adds `MediaAsset`, `AIGeneration`, `URLExtraction` tables and `Post.featuredImageId`

**Full guide**: See `RUN-MIGRATIONS.md`

---

### 3. **Set Up Supabase Storage** (3 minutes)

Media uploads need a Supabase Storage bucket.

**Steps**:
1. Open Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents from `packages/db/sql/phase6.5-storage-setup.sql`
3. Run the SQL
4. Verify: Storage → Check `media-assets` bucket exists

---

### 4. **Add OpenAI API Key** (2 minutes)

AI features won't work without this.

**Steps**:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard → `admin` project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add: `OPENAI_API_KEY` = `sk-...` (your OpenAI key)
3. Redeploy admin project (Vercel does this automatically)

---

### 5. **Run Smoke Tests** (10 minutes)

Manual testing to verify everything works:

**Site Tests**:
- [ ] Homepage loads
- [ ] Can switch language (EN/AR)
- [ ] Blog posts display
- [ ] Contact form works

**Admin Tests**:
- [ ] Can login

## 🛑 Blockers (If Any)

**Check**: Vercel dashboard → Deployments → Click on latest → View deployment logs

### Issue: Database Connection Errors

**Possible causes**:
- Wrong `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel environment variables
- Supabase database not accessible
- Connection pooler issues

**Fix**: Check Supabase dashboard → Settings → Database → Connection string

### Issue: Media Upload Fails

**Possible causes**:
- Supabase Storage not set up
- Missing `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in Vercel env vars
- RLS policies not configured

**Fix**: Run `packages/db/sql/phase6.5-storage-setup.sql` in Supabase

### Issue: AI Features Don't Work

**Possible causes**:
- Missing `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Invalid API key
- API key not yet propagated to Vercel

**Fix**: Add/verify API key in Vercel env vars, then redeploy
