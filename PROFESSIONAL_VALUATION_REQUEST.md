## Red Flags to Avoid

### Questionable Valuation Firms

❌ **Avoid firms that:**
- Promise specific valuations before seeing your business
- Offer "too good to be true" high valuations
- Don't require detailed financial information
- Have no tech/SaaS experience
- Can't provide references or past valuations
- Use only one valuation method
- Don't explain their methodology

✅ **Look for firms that:**
- Ask detailed questions about your business
- Provide range rather than specific number upfront
- Use multiple valuation methods
- Have technology industry experience
- Provide references and sample reports
- Are certified (ASA, NACVA, ABV credentials)
- Offer clear fee structure

---

## Alternative: Use AI Valuation First

**Before spending $10K-$40K on professional valuation:**

1. Generate AI valuation using your `INVESTMENT_VALUATION_PROMPT.md`
2. Share with 3-5 potential buyers
3. Gauge interest level
4. If serious interest emerges, then get professional valuation
5. Use professional valuation to close deal at higher price

**This approach saves you $10K-$40K unless you have serious buyers.**
