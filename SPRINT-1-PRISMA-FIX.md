# Sprint 1: Prisma Integration Fix

## Problem
The Sprint 1 API endpoints were returning 500 errors with "Failed to fetch topics/content/media" messages. The root cause was that the new Sprint 1 API routes were using a direct Supabase client, while the existing working API routes use Prisma ORM.

## Solution
Integrated the Sprint 1 database tables (`topics`, `content_library`, `media_library`) into the Prisma schema and updated all API routes to use Prisma for database operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Prisma Schema Updates (`apps/admin/prisma/schema.prisma`)
Added three new models:

- **Topic**: Content topic queue management
  - Fields: title, description, sourceUrl, sourceType, keywords, priority, status, locked, lockedAt, lockedBy, userNotes, aiSuggestions, metadata
  - Relations: One-to-many with ContentLibrary

- **ContentLibrary**: Content storage and management
  - Fields: title, content, contentType, status, authorId, lastEditedBy, wordCount, readingTimeMinutes, seoTitle, seoDescription, seoKeywords, featuredImageId, scheduledFor, aiGenerated, aiModel, aiPrompt, humanEdited, qualityScore
  - Relations: Many-to-one with Topic, One-to-many with MediaLibrary

- **MediaLibrary**: Media asset management
  - Fields: filename, originalFilename, storagePath, publicUrl, mimeType, fileSize, width, height, durationSeconds, altText, caption, tags, folder, uploadedBy, metadata
  - Relations: Many-to-one with ContentLibrary

### 2. API Route Updates
Updated all Sprint 1 API routes to use Prisma:

#### Topics API
- `apps/admin/app/api/topics/route.ts` - List and create topics
- `apps/admin/app/api/topics/[id]/route.ts` - Get, update, delete single topic
- `apps/admin/app/api/topics/[id]/lock/route.ts` - Lock/unlock topic

#### Content Library API
- `apps/admin/app/api/content-library/route.ts` - List and create content
- `apps/admin/app/api/content-library/[id]/route.ts` - Get, update, delete content

#### Media Library API
- `apps/admin/app/api/media-library/route.ts` - List and create media records
- `apps/admin/app/api/media-library/[id]/route.ts` - Get, update, delete media
- `apps/admin/app/api/media-library/upload/route.ts` - Upload files to Supabase Storage and create records

### 3. Key Changes in API Routes

**Before:**
```typescript
import { getSupabaseClient } from '@/lib/supabase';

const supabase = getSupabaseClient();
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('topics')
  .select('*');
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { prisma } from '@khaledaun/db';

const topics = await prisma.topic.findMany();
```

### 4. Benefits of Prisma Integration

1. **Consistency**: All API routes now use the same data access pattern
2. **Type Safety**: Prisma provides full TypeScript types for all models
3. **Better Error Handling**: Prisma errors are more descriptive and easier to debug
4. **Query Building**: Prisma's query builder is more intuitive than raw SQL
5. **Migrations**: Prisma migrations can track schema changes over time
6. **Relations**: Prisma handles relations automatically with `include` and `select`

### 5. Media Upload Flow
The media upload endpoint maintains Supabase Storage integration:
1. Validate file (type, size)
2. Upload to Supabase Storage bucket
3. Get public URL
4. Create database record using Prisma
5. On error, clean up uploaded file

## Testing
After deployment, test the following:

1. **Topics API**
   - GET `/api/topics` - List all topics
   - POST `/api/topics` - Create a new topic
   - GET `/api/topics/[id]` - Get single topic
   - PATCH `/api/topics/[id]` - Update topic
   - DELETE `/api/topics/[id]` - Delete topic
   - POST `/api/topics/[id]/lock` - Lock topic
   - DELETE `/api/topics/[id]/lock` - Unlock topic

2. **Content Library API**
   - GET `/api/content-library` - List all content
   - POST `/api/content-library` - Create new content
   - GET `/api/content-library/[id]` - Get single content
   - PATCH `/api/content-library/[id]` - Update content
   - DELETE `/api/content-library/[id]` - Delete content

3. **Media Library API**
   - GET `/api/media-library` - List all media
   - POST `/api/media-library` - Create media record
   - GET `/api/media-library/[id]` - Get single media
   - PATCH `/api/media-library/[id]` - Update media metadata
   - DELETE `/api/media-library/[id]` - Delete media (and from storage)
   - POST `/api/media-library/upload` - Upload file

## Next Steps
1. Wait for Vercel deployment to complete
2. Run smoke tests: `node test-sprint-1.js`
3. Manually test each endpoint in the admin UI
4. Verify data is being stored correctly in Supabase

## Database Schema
The Prisma models map to the following Supabase tables:
- `Topic` → `topics`
- `ContentLibrary` → `content_library`
- `MediaLibrary` → `media_library`

All tables were created using the `RUN-THIS-IN-SUPABASE.sql` script.
