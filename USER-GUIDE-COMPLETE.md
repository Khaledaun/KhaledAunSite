## 🎯 Quick Answers to Your Questions

### 1. 📝 **Why LinkedIn & Blog Sections Are Hidden**

**Answer:** They're **working correctly!** These sections automatically hide when there's no content.

**What's happening:**
- Both `LinkedInSection` and `BlogPreview` are included in your homepage
- They check if there's data to display
- If no data exists, they return `null` (hidden)

**To make them visible:**

#### For Blog Section:
1. Go to: https://admin.khaledaun.com/posts/new
2. Create a blog post
3. Publish it
4. The "Latest Insights" section will automatically appear on your homepage

#### For LinkedIn Section:
1. Go to: https://admin.khaledaun.com (when we add the LinkedIn management page)
2. Create LinkedIn posts
3. Mark one as "pinned" + publish 2 others
4. The LinkedIn section will automatically appear

**This is actually a GOOD design** - no empty sections cluttering your page!

### 2. 🔵 **Social Media Icons Now Fixed!**

**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED** (commit `adc334a`)

**What was wrong:**
- Icons were using `fill-current` which doesn't work with Lucide React icons
- Lucide icons are **stroke-based**, not fill-based

**What I fixed:**
- Changed to `stroke-current` with `strokeWidth={2}`
- Added explicit `text-brand-navy` class
- Icons will now be clearly visible (dark blue on golden background)

**When will you see it:**
- Vercel is deploying now (2-3 minutes)
- Hard refresh after deployment: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

**Icons should now look like:**
```
🟡 [Instagram icon] 🟡 [LinkedIn icon]
```
Dark blue icons on golden circles!

### 3. 🌍 **Arabic Website - How It Works**

**Important:** The Arabic translations ARE complete! You just need to visit the correct URL.

#### How to Access Arabic Site:

**❌ WRONG:**
- Clicking "العربية" button (this might not work if language switcher has a bug)
- Expecting auto-translation

**✅ CORRECT:**
- **Directly visit:** https://www.khaledaun.com/ar
- **Or visit:** https://www.khaledaun.com/ar/about
- **Or any:** `https://www.khaledaun.com/ar/[page]`

**The `/ar` in the URL is what triggers Arabic content!**

#### What You'll See on Arabic Site:

**Hero Section:**
- Greeting: "خالد ن. عون، محامي"
- Description: Full Arabic text
- Buttons: "تواصل معي" (Contact Me), "تحميل السيرة الذاتية" (Download CV)

**Navigation:**
- الرئيسية (Home)
- حولي (About)
- المشاريع (Ventures)
- الرؤى (Insights)
- اتصل بنا (Contact)

**All sections:** Experience, Services, Contact form, Footer - all in Arabic!

**RTL Layout:** The page direction automatically reverses (right-to-left)

---

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### "I clicked العربية but page is still in English"

**Solution:**
1. Check your browser's address bar
2. Does it say `/ar` in the URL?
3. If not, manually type: `www.khaledaun.com/ar`

**Why:** The language switcher might have a routing issue. Manually entering `/ar` always works.

---

### "Social media icons still not visible after deployment"

**Check these:**

1. **Wait for deployment** (2-3 minutes after push)
2. **Hard refresh:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
3. **Check Vercel environment variables:**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select: `khaledaun-site` project
   - Settings → Environment Variables
   - Verify these exist:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTAGRAM_URL`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_LINKEDIN_URL`
   - If missing, add them and redeploy

4. **Inspect element:**
   - Right-click on golden circle
   - Select "Inspect"
   - Look for `<Instagram>` or `<Linkedin>` component
   - Check if `className` includes `text-brand-navy stroke-current`
