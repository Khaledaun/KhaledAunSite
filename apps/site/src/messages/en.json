    "title": "About Khaled Aun",
    "description": "Disputes destroy value, relationships, and focus. My role is to end them decisively — or prevent them entirely.",
    "experience": "I bring clarity to chaotic situations. When founders clash, partnerships fracture, or deals go wrong, I help my clients see the full picture, understand their leverage, and execute a strategy that protects what matters most.",
    "philosophy": "Most business disputes don't need to go to court. They need someone who can diagnose the real problem, map the risks, and negotiate from strength. When litigation is necessary, I bring a commercial litigation background and the strategic discipline to see it through.",
