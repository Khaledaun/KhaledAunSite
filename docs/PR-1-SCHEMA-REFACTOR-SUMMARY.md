# PR #1: Phase 6 Full — Schema Refactor

**Branch:** `feat/phase6-full-schema`  
**Status:** ✅ **READY FOR REVIEW**  
**Date:** October 16, 2024

---

## 🎯 **OBJECTIVE**

Add bilingual support and expand RBAC roles for Phase 6 Full CMS.

---

## 📝 **CHANGES MADE**

### **1. Schema Changes** (`packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`)

#### **Added `Locale` Enum**
```prisma
enum Locale {
  en
  ar
}
```

#### **Expanded `Role` Enum**
**Before:**
```prisma
enum Role {
  USER
  ADMIN
}
```

**After:**
```prisma
enum Role {
  USER
  AUTHOR    // Can create and edit own posts, submit for review
  REVIEWER  // Can approve/reject posts
  EDITOR    // Can edit any post and publish
  OWNER     // Full access (site owner)
  ADMIN     // Full access (admin)
}
```

#### **Added `PostTranslation` Model**
```prisma
model PostTranslation {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  postId    String
  locale    Locale
  title     String
  slug      String
  excerpt   String?
  content   String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  post      Post     @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@unique([postId, locale])  // One translation per locale per post
  @@unique([locale, slug])     // Unique slugs per locale
  @@map("post_translations")
}
```

#### **Updated `Post` Model**
- Added `translations` relation to `PostTranslation[]`
- **NOTE:** Kept legacy fields (`title`, `slug`, `excerpt`, `content`) temporarily for backwards compatibility
- Legacy fields will be removed in a future migration after backfill is verified

---

### **2. Backfill Script** (`packages/db/scripts/backfill-phase6-full.ts`)

**Purpose:** Migrate existing single-language posts to bilingual model

**Features:**
- ✅ Creates English (`en`) translations for all existing posts
- ✅ Preserves original `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps
- ✅ Skips posts that already have translations (idempotent)
- ✅ Detailed logging with success/skip/error counts
- ✅ Exit code 1 on errors for CI/CD integration

**Usage:**
```bash
cd packages/db
pnpm tsx scripts/backfill-phase6-full.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🚀 Starting Phase 6 Full backfill migration...

📊 Found 5 posts to migrate

✅ Migrated post "Welcome to Phase 6 Lite CMS" (slug: welcome-to-phase-6-lite)
✅ Migrated post "Another Post" (slug: another-post)
...

============================================================
📊 Backfill Migration Summary:
============================================================
✅ Successfully migrated: 5 posts
⏭️  Skipped (already migrated): 0 posts
❌ Errors: 0 posts
============================================================

🎉 Backfill migration completed successfully!
```

---

### **3. Verification Script** (`packages/db/scripts/verify-post-translations.ts`)

**Purpose:** Verify data integrity after backfill migration

**Tests:**
1. ✅ All posts have at least one translation
2. ✅ All posts have English (`en`) translation
3. ✅ No duplicate slugs per locale
4. ✅ Translation statistics (EN/AR counts)
5. ✅ Data integrity for sample posts (legacy fields match translations)

**Usage:**
```bash
cd packages/db
pnpm tsx scripts/verify-post-translations.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🔍 Starting Phase 6 Full verification...

Test 1: Checking all posts have at least one translation...
✅ All posts have at least one translation

Test 2: Checking all posts have English (en) translation...

### **4. Updated Seed Script** (`packages/db/seed.ts`)

**Before:**
- Created 1 user: ADMIN

**After:**
- Creates 5 users with different roles:
  - `owner@khaledaun.com` → OWNER
  - `admin@khaledaun.com` → ADMIN
  - `editor@khaledaun.com` → EDITOR
  - `author@khaledaun.com` → AUTHOR
  - `reviewer@khaledaun.com` → REVIEWER

**Usage:**
```bash
cd packages/db
pnpm db:seed
```

---

## 🧪 **TESTING PERFORMED**

### **1. Schema Validation**
```bash
cd packages/db
pnpm exec prisma validate
```
**Result:** ✅ Schema is valid

### **2. Migration (Local)**
```bash
cd packages/db
pnpm db:push
```
**Result:** ✅ Schema pushed successfully
**Tables created:**
- `post_translations` (new)
- Updated `users` table with new Role enum values

### **3. Backfill Script**
```bash
pnpm tsx scripts/backfill-phase6-full.ts
```
**Result:** ✅ 5 posts migrated to English translations

### **4. Verification Script**
```bash
pnpm tsx scripts/verify-post-translations.ts
```
**Result:** ✅ All 5 tests passed

### **5. Re-run Seed**

pnpm db:seed
```
**Result:** ✅ 5 users created (OWNER, ADMIN, EDITOR, AUTHOR, REVIEWER)

---

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### **For Staging/Production:**

1. **Push schema to database:**
   ```bash
   cd packages/db
   export DATABASE_URL="<production-pooled-url>"
   export DIRECT_URL="<production-direct-url>"
   pnpm db:push
   ```

2. **Run backfill migration:**
   ```bash
   pnpm tsx scripts/backfill-phase6-full.ts
   ```

3. **Verify migration:**
   ```bash
   pnpm tsx scripts/verify-post-translations.ts
   ```

4. **Re-seed users (optional, if new roles needed):**
   ```bash
   pnpm db:seed
   ```

5. **Deploy apps:**
   - Redeploy `apps/admin`
   - Redeploy `apps/site`

6. **Verify deployment:**
   ```bash
   curl https://admin.khaledaun.com/api/health
   curl https://khaledaun.vercel.app/api/health
   ```

---

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTES**

### **Backwards Compatibility**
- ✅ Legacy `title`, `slug`, `excerpt`, `content` fields are preserved on `Post` model
- ✅ Existing admin APIs continue to work (they read from legacy fields)
- ✅ New APIs (PR #3) will read from `translations` relation
- ⚠️ Legacy fields will be removed in a future PR after all APIs are updated

### **Migration Safety**
- ✅ Backfill script is idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)
- ✅ No data loss (all fields copied to translations)
- ✅ Timestamps preserved
- ✅ Verification script catches issues

### **Rollback Plan**
If issues arise:
1. Revert the schema changes in Prisma
2. Run `pnpm db:push` (will drop `post_translations` table)
3. Redeploy apps with previous schema

**Data Loss:** Only `post_translations` table will be lost. Original post data in `posts` table remains intact.

---

## 🔄 **NEXT STEPS (PR #2)**

After this PR is merged:
1. ✅ Create `packages/auth/permissions.ts` (RBAC helpers)
2. ✅ Wire permission checks into admin APIs
3. ✅ Test AUTHOR can't publish, EDITOR/OWNER/ADMIN can
